## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `private` is set to true by default in pesde.toml to prevent accidentally publishing the root project

## [0.2.2] - 2025-10-31

### Changed

- Supplying a pesde token is now optional

### Fixed

- Pesde token being used to authenticate with github

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-30

### Fixed

- Release CI no longer installs Rokit (tooling is managed by pesde now)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-30

### Changed

- New default Lune version is 0.10.4
- New default pesde version is 0.7.1
- Test CI now also runs the Lune runtime

- Contents of pesde packages are now ignored by auto import by default
